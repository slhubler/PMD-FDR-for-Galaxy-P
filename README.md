# PMD-FDR-for-Galaxy-P
Monolithic script and example batch file for PMD-FDR

## Files
_PMD_FDR_package_for_Galaxy.R_ - combines 4 files across 3 projects, allowing all of the pieces to live in one place

_example_batch_file.cmd_ - a sample batch file that shows how to pass parameters to the R script

## Future work
All of the underlying structures have been developed using test-driven development -- I intend to include the test files (and test structures) in the near future. These will also offer clues in how to use the various packages included here; i.e. each test is, in effect, a vignette with a practical demonstration of at least one requirement.
